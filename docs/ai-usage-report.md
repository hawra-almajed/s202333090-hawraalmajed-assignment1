I used AWS CodeWhisperer to generate the initial code based on the requirements which are: 


About Me → 2–3 sentence intro, tagline/one-liner, optional profile image.
Projects → at least 2 projects (title, short description, placeholder image).
Contact → form with Name, Email, Message (no backend needed).

Responsive Design
Must display well on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
Use CSS Grid/Flexbox

Interactivity
Add at least one JavaScript feature, such as:

Smooth scrolling
Dark/light theme toggle
Greeting message by time of day
Form or button interactions

this helped me because I had to complete the website in less than 2 days
